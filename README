Java Artistic Style Library
----------------------------

This is a fork of Hector Suarez Barenca's port of Astyle to java from http://sourceforge.net/projects/jastyle/

It is also a fork of Stephen Connolly's Maven version from https://github.com/stephenc/jastyle

Unlike The original version, this version has been modified to work as a library as well as from the Command line.
